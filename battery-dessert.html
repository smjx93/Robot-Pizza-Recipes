    <h2>What the heck is it?</h2>
        <p>Interestingly enough a battery is called a "pile" in some languages becuase a long time ago they would pile up discs of stuff that stored electricity.</p>
        <p>Well enough of the history lesson. Just ask your favorite robot, what he loves more than anything. The robot would probably say energy! Becuase whats a robot without electricity?  
           Probably a useless machine? Well let's fix that with a little battery juice!</p> 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <p>Literally go find a bunch of new batteries. It's really not that complicated. </p> 
        <p> Unless you don't know where to find them. Well in that case just ask your robot friend to help you before he runs out of electricity.</p> 
        <p><ul>
            <li> Piles of batteries. The more the merrier.</li>
            <li> Some cables. </li>
            <li> Whatever else you think makes a good battery.</li>
        </ul></p>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Put the batteries in neat row. </li>
            <p><li>Hook up all the cables to the robot.</li></p>          
            <p><li>Flip the switch and watch your robot friend smile.</li></p>
            <li>Serve with a drizzle of machine oil. No, I'm kidding. No machine oil this time.  </li>
        </ol>
